this is a image filter that like instagram。
it is base on gpuimage。

and the idea from the instagram filters for ios where is also use the gpuimage。

the filter code is in the filter package in the sample model，you can copy it to your project。

# GPUImage for Android

Idea from: [iOS GPUImage framework](https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage)

Goal is to have something as similar to GPUImage as possible. Vertex and fragment shaders are exactly the same. That way it makes it easier to port filters from GPUImage iOS to Android.

## Requirements
